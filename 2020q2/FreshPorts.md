FreshPorts, and its sister site, FreshSource, have reported
upon FreeBSD commits for 20 years. They cover all commits,
not just ports.

FreshPorts tracks the commits and extracts data from the
port Makefiles to create a database of information useful
to both port developers and port users.

For example, https://www.freshports.org/security/acme.sh/ shows
the history of this port, back to its creation in May 2017.

### Packages ###

FreshPorts now displays the packages version available from the
repo sources. This covers all primary tiers (e.g. FreeBSD:12:amd64)
and all secondary tiers (e.g. FreeBSD:13:powerpc64). This helps
uses know what versions they can expect and when then repo was last
built.

### Dependency lines ###

Somethings are easiest done via copy/paste. If you are working on a port
Makefile and need to add a new dependency, FreshPorts shows the dependency
line for that port.  For example:

```
acme.sh>0:security/acme.sh
```

Libraries are also covered by this feature.

Python ports were recently adjusted to display

```
 ${PYTHON_PKGNAMEPREFIX}virtualenv>0:devel/py-virtualenv
```

instead of

```
py37-virtualenv>0:devel/py-virtualenv
```

You can read more about this change in [issue
#73](https://github.com/FreshPorts/freshports/issues/73).


### Watch ports I maintain ###

The [search page](https://www.freshports.org/search.php) has long had
the "Ports I Maintain" button (if you are logged in). This feature recently
branched out to a new auomated watch list option: `Watch ports I maintain`.

This [report subscription](https://www.freshports.org/report-subscriptions.php) 
will notify you of any commits to the ports you maintain. Your email 
address on FreshPorts must match the value in the MAINTAINER field of the port.
This is always a daily report.

From time to time, an infrastructure change will occur which touches your
port. This feature ensures you know about that change.

### Repology links ###

Repology links were requested. This allows you to see what versions of that
port are in the repositories of other systems. A link to repology.org
appears on every port page.

Based upon [Things you didnâ€™t know FreshPorts can do] (https://news.freshports.org/2019/09/03/things-you-didnt-know-freshports-can-do/)


There are many things FreshPorts can do, including search `Makefile`s and
`pkg-plist`. This is from a recent blog post:

* provides example dependency line. e.g. p5-XML-RSS>0:textproc/p5-XML-RSS
* list of dependencies for a port
* list of ports depending upon this port
* Default configuration options
* what packages install a given file (e.g. bin/unzip)
* what ports does this person maintain?
* which Makefiles contain a reference to bunzip?
* search results can be plain-text consisting of a list of foo/bar ports
* The Maximum Effort checkbox on the search page does nothing.
* Committers can be notified of sanity test failures after the commit
* Find a commit, any commit, based on SVN revision number, e.g. : https://www.freshports.org/commit.php?revision=352332


### Javascript help wanted ###

We [recently upgraded](https://github.com/FreshPorts/freshports/commit/f620270161dd7818272dfebacacaaf26df5f37e6)
some outdated Javascript modules. This broke our [Javascript based
graphs](https://www.freshports.org/graphs2.php). We could use some help on
fixing that please. The starting points are listed on that URL.  If you need
a working website to play with, please contact me with an ssh public-key.
