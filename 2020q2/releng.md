The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
and publishing release schedules for official project releases
of FreeBSD, announcing code slushes, and maintaining the respective
branches, among other things.

During the second quarter of 2020, the Release Engineering Team started
work on the 11.4-RELEASE cycle, the fifth release from the stable/11
branch.  The release cycle went quite smoothly, with both BETA3 and RC3
removed from the schedule.  This allowed the final release to occur one
week earlier than originally scheduled, which was announced June 16.
FreeBSD 11.4-RELEASE is expected to be the final 11.x release.

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team would like to thank everyone involved
in this cycle for their hard work.

Additionally throughout the quarter, several development snapshots builds
were released for the *head*, *stable/12*, and *stable/11* branches.

Much of this work was sponsored by Rubicon Communications, LLC (netgate.com)
and the FreeBSD Foundation.
