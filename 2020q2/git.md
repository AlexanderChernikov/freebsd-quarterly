Work continues on FreeBSD's migration from Subversion to Git.  Ulrich has
iterated on updates to svn2git in order to improve the fidelity of the
conversion, particularly in regards to vendor (contrib) code updates.
We believe the conversion is now at an acceptable state, but may make minor
adjustments if additional issues are found.  We expect to push modifications
to the converter every two weeks (first and third Sunday of the month).  This
means that commit hashes in the beta repo will remain stable for at least two
weeks at a time, to allow others to test and experiment with the beta repo.

We are now working on updating FreeBSD processes and documentation.
This includes:
 - Writing a Git Primer, akin to the existing Subversion primer
 - Updates to the Security Team's tools and processes
 - Release engineering updates
 - Ports and packages process updates

Those with an interest in the migration to Git are encouraged to subscribe
to the
[FreeBSD-git mailing list](https://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-git)
and test out the beta src, ports, and/or doc repositories.
