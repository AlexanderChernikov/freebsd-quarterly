## FreeBSD Core Team ##

Contact: FreeBSD Core Team <core@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD Core Team is the governing body of FreeBSD.

The Core Team held 10 meetings during the second quarter of 2020, including a
2020-05-21 joint meeting with members of the FreeBSD Foundation.  Here are some
highlights from that meeting.

  - Deb requested guidance on how the Foundation can support the community.
    Core and Foundation members believe that more developer support is necessary
    to fill gaps in areas where commercial customers do not provide backing.
    The clearest example of such a gap is the desktop experience, including
    graphics and wireless support.  What makes this request different from past
    requests is that rather than support for one-time projects, ongoing
    positions are necessary for a consistently high-quality desktop experience.

         irrelevance." Ed Maste

  - Both teams discussed topics for upcoming sessions of FreeBSD Office Hours,
    informal FreeBSD video conferences that anyone can attend.  Everyone agreed
    that the Office Hours have been a useful way for different parts of the
    Project to engage with each other and with the wider community.  Kudos to
    Allan Jude for initiating the Office Hours and for everyone who has helped
    make them a success by hosting or attending sessions.

  - Both teams agreed that they should meet once per quarter.

The second annual community survey closed on 2020-06-16.  The purpose of the
survey is to collect data from the public to help guide the Project's efforts
and priorities.  As an example, last year's survey results helped initiate the
Project's conversion to Git.  Thank you to all who took the time to respond. The
results will be released soon.

The Core-initiated Git Working Group continued to make progress, but there are
still some remaining issues to be worked out with the translation from
Subversion.  Hopefully the new Git src repository will be ready for use this
summer.  A [beta version](https://cgit-beta.freebsd.org/) has been published for
people to test and a preliminary version of a `Using Git for FreeBSD
Development` primer will soon be ready to share.  Core, the Git Working Group,
and Release Engineering are working towards the goal of releasing 12.2 from the
new Git repository.

Following the results of a Core-initiated developer survey, The FreeBSD Project
has adopted a new LLVM-derived [code of
conduct](https://www.freebsd.org/internal/code-of-conduct.html).

The eleventh FreeBSD Core Team was elected by active developers.  From a pool of
23, the 9 successful candidates for core.11 are:

  - Sean Chittenden (seanc, incumbent)
  - Baptiste Daroussin (bapt)
  - Kyle Evans (kevans)
  - Mark Johnston (markj)
  - Scott Long (scottl)
  - Warner Losh (imp, incumbent)
  - Ed Maste (emaste)
  - George V. Neville-Neil (gnn)
  - Hiroki Sato (hrs, incumbent)

A new Core Team secretary, Muhammad Moinur Rahman (bofh), was unanimously
approved by core.11.  The outgoing core team met three times with the new core
team to help with the transition.  Core.10 wishes core.11 a successful term.
