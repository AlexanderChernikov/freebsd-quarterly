The drm drivers for FreeBSD 13-CURRENT have been updated to match Linux 5.3
This brings us a little bit closer to the last LTS release of Linux (5.4).

The current plan is to first update the driver to match 5.4 and then look
at making it work on FreeBSD-12-STABLE to have it ready for the 12.2 release.
