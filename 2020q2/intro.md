This report will be covering FreeBSD related projects between April and June, 
and covers a diverse set of topics ranging from kernel updates over userland 
and ports, as well to third-party work.

Some hilights picked with the roll of a d100 include but are not limmited to
the ability to forcibly unmounting UFS when the underlying media becomes
inaccessible, added support for Bluetooth Low Energy, a introduction to the
FreeBSD Office Hours, and a repository of software collections called potluck
to be installed with the pot utility, as well as many many more things.

As a little treat, readers can also get a rare report from the quarterly team.

Finally, on behalf of the quarterly team, I would like to extend my deepest 
appreciation and thank you to salvadore@, who decided to take down his shingle.
His contribution to not just the quarterly reports themselves, but also the
surrounding tooling to many-fold ease the work, is immeassurable.

We hope you find the report as interesting as we have,
Daniel Ebdrup Jensen, on behalf of the quarterly team.
