chaifi is a TUI (text UI) utility aimed at simplifying the process of joining
public WiFi networks in places like coffee shops or libraries. It replaces the
process of scanning and manually editing wpa_supplicant.conf with an
interactive dialog. The utility is in no way a replacement for full-featured
network managers in major desktop environments. Still, if you're working from a
console or using a tiling window manager, it may save you some seconds (or in
worst case minutes) of your time.
