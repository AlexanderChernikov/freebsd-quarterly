SageMath is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed
under the GPL. It builds on top of many existing open-source packages:
NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Sympy, Maxima, GAP, FLINT, R and many more.
Thanks to SageMath it is possible to access their combined power through a
common, Python-based language or directly via interfaces or wrappers.

The goal is creating a viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple,
Mathematica and Matlab.

This is a complex port, with a lot of dependencies, and it has been
broken for some time. Upstream is working on easing its packaging, and
many previously bundled applications can now be replaced by external
packages.

If you are interested, it would be nice to create a team of maintainers

* to maintain some of the dependencies;
* to maintain SageMath itself and prepare the next release (9.2 is coming!).
