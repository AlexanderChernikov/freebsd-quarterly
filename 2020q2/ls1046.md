The Semihalf team initiated working on FreeBSD support for the
[NXP LS1046A SoC](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-based-processors-and-mcus/qoriq-layerscape-arm-processors/qoriq-layerscape-1046a-and-1026a-multicore-communications-processors:LS1046A)

LS1046A are quad-core 64-bit ARMv8 Cortex-A72 processors with
integrated packet processing acceleration and high speed peripherals
including 10 Gb Ethernet, PCIe 3.0, SATA 3.0 and USB 3.0 for a wide
range of networking, storage, security and industrial applications.

Completed since the last update:
  * Improve code in a couple of review cycles and merge following new
    features to the FreeBSD-HEAD (r361458 - r361464):
    * QorIQ platform clockgen driver
    * LS1046A clockgen driver
    * GPIO support for QorIQ boards
    * QorIQ LS10xx AHCI driver
    * VF610 I2C controller support
    * TCA6416 GPIO expander
    * Epson RX-8803 RTC

Todo:
 * Upstreaming of the QorIQ SDHCI driver - it is expected to
   be submitted/merged to HEAD in the Q3 of 2020.
