MixerTUI is a volume mixer with a Terminal User Interface built on the FreeBSD
sound system. It can show the current Sound Driver configuration and select an
audio device: to get its information, change the volume or to set as default,
the last feature allows to switch easily audio from/to laptop and hdmi,
headphones and speakers, and so on.  
MixerTUI can be installed via the audio/mixertui port.
