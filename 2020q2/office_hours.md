Starting on the first of April 2020, the FreeBSD project has started
hosting regular video streams to foster greater communication within
the wider FreeBSD community. The first of these sessions took the form
of a public question and answer session, which drew over 60 participants.
A second session was held two weeks later at a time more appropriate for
those in Asia, but only drew 20 participants. With the help of the FreeBSD
Foundation, we ran a poll to discover what times worked best for the
greatest number of people.

On May 13th the FreeBSD Foundation hosted a session where the community
could ask questions of or about the foundation. On May 27th many of the
candidates for the new FreeBSD Core Team joined an office hours session to
answer questions from the community. Finally on June 24th another general
question and answer office hours was held.

Each office hours session consists of a video meeting of some FreeBSD
developers or other subject matter experts, live streamed along with an IRC
chat room for viewers to pose questions to the panel. The stream is recorded
and posted to the official FreeBSD youtube channel.
