The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
and publishing release schedules for official project releases
of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective
branches, among other things.

During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Release Engineering Team completed
work on 12.2-RELEASE, the third release from the stable/12 branch, released
on October 27.  Thank you to all involved for the hard work that went into
this release.

Additionally throughout the quarter, several development snapshots builds
were released for the *head*, *stable/12*, and *stable/11* branches.
Development snapshot builds for 13.0-CURRENT have recently been built from
the Git tree within the project, while further snapshot builds for 12.x and
11.x will continue to be built from Subversion.  As we approach the end of
2020, continued preparations are being put in place for the upcoming 13.0
release, which will be the first release from Git.

Much of this work was sponsored by Rubicon Communications, LLC (netgate.com)
and the FreeBSD Foundation.
