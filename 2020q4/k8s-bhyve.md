K8S-bhyve is opensource project concentrating primarily to deploy and use
kubernetes on FreeBSD/bhyve in a more agile and more comfortable manner.
We are going to provide distributed multi-DC environment or just stand-alone
clusters with native PV/PVC support.

For 2020q4 we made and published k8s-bhyve image which
you might install with [ISO/memstick](https://k8s-bhyve.convectix.com/kbhyve-latest.iso),
as well as with [bsdinstall](http://k8s.bsdstore.ru/auto).
