The KDE on FreeBSD project aims to package all of the software 
produced by the KDE Community for the FreeBSD ports tree.
The software includes a full desktop environment called KDE Plasma, 
graphics applications, instant-messengers, a video-editing suite,
as well as a tea timer
and hundreds of other applications that can be used on
any FreeBSD machine.

The KDE team (kde@) is part of desktop@ and x11@ as well,
building the software stack to make FreeBSD beautiful and usable
as a daily-driver graphics-based desktop machine.

This quarter the kde@ team:

 * Landed the October, November and December updates to KDE Applications
   and to KDE Plasma
 * Landed all of the bi-weekly KDE Frameworks releases
 * Updated Qt to 5.12.2, including Qt5 WebEngine
 * Followed up with two cmake patch releases
 * Followed up one ninja patch release

There was lots of infrastructural work and individual application
updates and a new Matrix client from the KDE community
as well, which we typically fail to administer and write about
so this report is fairly short with mostly big-ticket items.
We had fun, we chased the things that are most useful to
us, and got through the year. Here's to next year with
actually seeing FreeBSD people again.

I (adridg@) would like to especially thank Kai Knoblich (kai@) for chasing WebEngine:
that's a huge and painful codebase to deal with, and here we
are, all up-to-date.
