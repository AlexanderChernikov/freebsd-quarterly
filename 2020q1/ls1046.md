The Semihalf team initiated working on FreeBSD support for the
[NXP LS1046A SoC](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-based-processors-and-mcus/qoriq-layerscape-arm-processors/qoriq-layerscape-1046a-and-1026a-multicore-communications-processors:LS1046A)

LS1046A are quad-core 64-bit ARMv8 Cortex-A72 processors with
integrated packet processing acceleration and high speed peripherals
including 10 Gb Ethernet, PCIe 3.0, SATA 3.0 and USB 3.0 for a wide
range of networking, storage, security and industrial applications.

Completed since the last update:
  * Clean-up and rebase support on top of the FreeBSD-HEAD. Prepare features
    for the upstream submission:
    * QorIQ platform clockgen driver
    * LS1046A clockgen driver
    * GPIO support for QorIQ boards
    * QorIQ LS10xx AHCI driver
    * VF610 I2C controller support
    * TCA6416 GPIO expander
    * Epson RX-8803 RTC
    * QorIQ LS10xx SDHCI driver

Todo:
   * Upstreaming of developed features. This work is expected to
     be submitted/merged to HEAD in the Q2 of 2020.
