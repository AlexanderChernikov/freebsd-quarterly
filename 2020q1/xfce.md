After the XFCE update to 4.14 a regression was observed in the XFCE
window manager xfwm4. It caused window decorations to be drawn wrong
or missing with certain graphic hardware setups. It has been reported
that the recent update to Xorg server in the ports tree fixes this
issue.  The updated Xorg server will be available in the next
qurterly branch.
