NomadBSD is a persistent live system for USB flash drives, based on FreeBSD.
Together with automatic hardware detection and setup, it is configured to be
used as a desktop system that works out of the box, but can also be used for
data recovery, for educational purposes, or testing FreeBSD's hardware
compatibility.

In March we released a new minor version 1.3.1 which improves the configuration
of the network interfaces, fixed some bugs and added nomadbsd-chusr and
nomadbsd-sysinfo. Further some new features found their way into the release.

Some days later the channel explainingcomputers on YouTube released a review video of
NomadBSD. The explainingcomputers has almost 600,000 followers and the review was positive
so we saw the highest peak in downloads ever! Along with it came a lot of people looking for
help on our mailing list and on Twitter so we decided to set up a new support forum.

We are looking for people to help the project. Help is much appreciated in all areas:

  * Translation of program interfaces
  * Design artwork
  * Programming new tools, extend existing ones
  * Tests and Bug reports / UX and feature suggestions
  * Mirrors outside of Europe

Open tasks:

  * Support installation on disk partitions and add a partition editor GUI.
  * Complete disk encryption
  * Add a user-friendly network manager
