- Core requested that the freebsd-mobile@ list be retired as it was almost
  exclusively receiving spam.  postmaster@ completed core's request.
  
- Core approved third party authentication for some project services with
  certain conditions.  For example, for authentication with Google, users must
  be using a FreeBSD.org account with two-factor authentication enabled.  For
  GitHub, we will enable and force multi-factor authentication for our
  organization.

- The Core-initiated Git Transition Working Group continued to meet over the
  first quarter of 2020.  Their report is still forthcoming.
