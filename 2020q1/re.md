The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
and publishing release schedules for official project releases
of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the
respective branches, among other things.

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team published the schedules for the upcoming
11.4-RELEASE and 12.2-RELEASE cycles.

Much time was spent by Glen Barber working on updates to the various build
tools adding support for builds from both Subversion and Git.  This is very
much a work in progress, as there are a number of inter-connected moving
parts.

Additionally throughout the quarter, several development snapshots builds
were released for the *head*, *stable/12*, and *stable/11* branches.

Much of this work was sponsored by Rubicon Communications, LLC (netgate.com)
and the FreeBSD Foundation.
