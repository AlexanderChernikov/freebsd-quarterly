Welcome, to the quarterly reports, of the future! Well, at least the first
quarterly report from 2020.  The new timeline, mentioned in the last few 
reports, still holds, which brings us to this report, which covers the period
of January 2020 - March 2020.

As you will see from this report, we've had quite an active quarter with big
changes to both kernel, userland, documentation, ports, and third-party
projects in the form of everything from bug and security fixes over new features
to speed improvements and optimizations.

As this report also covers the start of the epidemic, it's also interesting to
note that a quick glance at the svn logs reveal that there has been no overall
drop in number of source commits, that docs commits have also stayed constant, 
and that ports have seen an upwards trend.

We hope that all of you are and yours are as safe as can be managed, and that
we get through this together by working together.
