An initial effort to write proper documentation and guides for the pot project has started. The documentation, even if incomplete, is available at [here](https://pot.pizzamig.dev). A [F.A.Q.](https://pot.pizzamig.dev/FAQ/) page is available and waiting for users to submit their questions.

During the last quarter, some bugs were reported on pot and on the nomad-pot-driver. Both projects released a new bug fix version. 
Many thanks to 'grembo' and 'Crest' that reported issues, tested and tried our solutions.  
Thanks also to Mateusz (0mp) for his Pull Requests!

pot will have a new release soon (0.11.0), focused on network:

* network stack support: ipv4 only, ipv6 only, dual stack.
* flexible network setup for alias: adding the ability to use an arbitrary network setup for alias network type

Contributions are welcome! Label "good first issue" has been added to issues to invite newcomers to contribute to the project!
