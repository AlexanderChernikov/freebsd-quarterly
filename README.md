FreeBSD Quarterly Status Reports
================================

### Drafts

This repository is for drafts. 

Please submit your draft as early as possible. To submit:

1. Fork the repository - reusing an old fork is OK.
2. Enter the directory for the current time period - `2019q4`.
3. Create a new file, with a name that corresponds with the name of
   your project - use the `report-sample.md` template.
4. Create a pull request.

You can tweak things afterwards. Simply edit, then submit another PR.

Please do not worry excessively about language errors or Markdown
syntax - we can correct things for you.
