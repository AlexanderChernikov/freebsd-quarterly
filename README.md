### Drafts

This repository is for drafts. 

Please submit your draft as early as possible. To submit:

1. fork the repository – reusing an old fork is OK
2. enter the directory for the current time period – `2019q4`
3. create a new file, with a name that corresponds with the name of your project – use the `report-sample.md` template
4. create a pull request.

You can tweak things afterwards. Simply edit, then submit another PR.

Please do not worry excessively about language errors or Markdown syntax – we can correct things for you.
