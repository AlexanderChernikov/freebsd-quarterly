FreshPorts consolidates commits into an easy-to-follow
format so you can track changes to your favorite ports.
It also process src, doc, and www commit.  It processes
incoming emails from the commit mailing lists and updates
the database based upon what it finds.

In early September I started looking at at how FreshPorts
could use a git repository for processing commits. The 
result was (an approach](https://news.freshports.org/2019/09/02/git-and-freshports/) for identifying new commits and
for iterating through them.

The next idea was [commit hooks](https://news.freshports.org/2019/09/18/moving-towards-commit-hooks/) but the most interesting
bit of that exercise was commit iteration.

At EuroBSDCon 2019, I wrote up a small requirements section
the FreshPorts received great help from two sources:

* Jan-Piet MENS recommended a [Python library])https://www.freshports.org/devel/py-gitpython/) and
  turned out to be great

* Sergey Kozlov wrote Python code to create xml using
  that Python library

Returning home from the conference, I created a new
FreshPorts instance for processing git based on the above.

The remaining tasks:

  * automate the script (git pull, etc)
  * detect new commits (for later iteration)
  * design a light-weight git hook
