The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
and publishing release schedules for official project releases
of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the
respective branches, among other things.

[XXX: Quarterly report stuff goes here.]
During the third quarter of 2019, the FreeBSD Release Engineering team
finished the 11.3-RELEASE cycle, with the final release build started on
July 5th and the official announcement sent on July 9th.

FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE is the fourth release from the *stable/11* branch,
building on the stability and reliability of 11.2-RELEASE.

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team also started work on the upcoming
12.1-RELEASE, which started September 6th.  This release cycle is the
first "freeze-less" release from the Subversion repository, and the test bed
for eliminating the requirement of a hard code freeze on development branches.
Commits to the *releng/12.1* branch still require explicit approval from
the Release Engineering Team, however.

At present, there have been three BETA builds, and so far, two RC builds, with
the final 12.1-RELEASE build scheduled for November 4th.

Additionally throughout the quarter, several development snapshots builds
were released for the *head* and *stable/11* branches.

Much of this work was sponsored by Rubicon Communications, LLC (Netgate)
and the FreeBSD Foundation.
