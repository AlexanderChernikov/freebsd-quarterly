Several members of the security team met at the Vendor Summit in October to
formalize team structure dedicated for architecture and crypto engineering in
addition to the existing product security incident response function.

Since June we have started having fortnightly conference calls to discuss
important issues and to collaborate closely on advisories and errata notices in
the pipeline.

  * Security advisories sent out in 2019-Q3: 7
  * Errata Notices sent out in 2019-Q3: 5
