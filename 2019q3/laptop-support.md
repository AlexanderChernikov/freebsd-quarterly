## Improving laptop support ##

Contact: Ed Maste <emaste@FreeBSD.org>  

The FreeBSD Foundation would like to ensure that running FreeBSD on
contemporary hardware, including laptops, remains viable.  To that end
we plan to purchase the latest generation of one or more of a family
of laptops preferred by members of the FreeBSD community, evaluate the
existing state of hardware support, and implement missing hardware
support where possible.

As the first laptop for this project we have selected a 7th Generation
Lenovo X1 Carbon.
