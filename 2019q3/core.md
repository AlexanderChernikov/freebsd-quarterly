- Kernel Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) maintainership was updated to
  reduce the contribution barrier for committers who have demonstrated
  competence in this part of the tree.

- Core approved a source commit bit for Paweł Biernacki.  Konstantin Belousov
  <kib@> will mentor Paweł and Mateusz Guzik <mjg@> will be co-mentor.

- The Core-initiated Git Transition Working Group met over the last quarter,
  however a report is still forthcoming.  Discussions will continue in the
  fourth quarter of 2019.  There are many issues to resolve including how to
  deal with contrib/, whether to re-generate hashes in the current Git
  repository, and how to best implement commit testing.
