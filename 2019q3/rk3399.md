## Rockchip RK3399 SoC's eMMC support ##

Contact: Ganbold Tsagaankhuu, <ganbold@FreeBSD.org>

Followings are done to support RK3399 SoC eMMC on FreeBSD:

  * Extended simple_mfd driver to expose a syscon interface if
    that node is also compatible with syscon. For instance,
    Rockchip RK3399's GRF (General Register Files) is compatible
    with simple-mfd as well as syscon and has devices like
    usb2-phy, emmc-phy and pcie-phy etc. under it.
  * Made Rockchip's General Register Files driver the subclass of Simple MFD driver
  * Added driver for Rockchip RK3399 eMMC PHY.
  * Added eMMC support codes for Rockchip RK3399 SoC.
  * All above was tested on NanoPC-T4 board.
