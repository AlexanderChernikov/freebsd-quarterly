Here is the last quarterly status report for 2019. As you might remember
from last report, we changed our timeline: now we collect reports the last
month of each quarter and we edit and publish the full document the next
month. Thus, we cover here the period October 2019 - December 2019.

If you thought that the FreeBSD community was less active in the
Christmas' quarter you will be glad to be proven wrong: a quick glance at
the summary will be sufficient to see that much work has been done in the
last months.

Have a nice read!
