Electron is a popular framework to build desktop application using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
Few months ago, electronjs has been added to the ports tree.
Currently version 4.x and 6.x are supported.

In the last quarter, a popular application, the powerful VSCode editor, has been added to the ports tree as well.
VSCode is based on electron 6.x

atom, another popular editor, is still a work in progress and it's based on electron 4.x

Many thanks to Hiroki, for the hard work, and to Antoine, to support the special poudriere configuration needed to build VSCode.
