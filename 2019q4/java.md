During Q4 the FreeBSD java porting effort features smaller updates than
those of the previous quarters.  However, the following changes are worth
mentioning:

  * Updated ports for OpenJDK 8u232, 11.0.5, and 13.0.1
  * Removal of the EOL'ed Java 6, 9, and 10 ports
  * Fixed remote debugging for Java 11+
  * Fixed a problem with running external processes for Java 11+
