The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
and publishing release schedules for official project releases
of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the
respective branches, among other things.

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team continued work on the 12.1-RELEASE, which
started September 6th.  This release cycle was the first "freeze-less" release
from the Subversion repository, and the test bed for eliminating the requirement
of a hard code freeze on development branches.

The 12.1-RELEASE cycle concluded with the final build beginning November 4th,
preceded by three BETA builds and two RC builds.  The RC3 build had been
included in the original schedule, but had been decided to not be required.

Additionally throughout the quarter, several development snapshots builds
were released for the *head*, *stable/12*, and *stable/11* branches.

Much of this work was sponsored by Rubicon Communications, LLC (Netgate)
and the FreeBSD Foundation.
