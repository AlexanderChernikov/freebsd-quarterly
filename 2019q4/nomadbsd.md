NomadBSD is a persistent live system for USB flash drives, based on FreeBSD®.
Together with automatic hardware detection and setup, it is configured to be
used as a desktop system that works out of the box, but can also be used for
data recovery, for educational purposes, or to test FreeBSD®'s hardware
compatibility.

After one release candidate the NomadBSD Team finished and released NomadBSD
1.3 on December 7th.
This release is based on FreeBSD 12.1, fixed a lot of bugs and added new
packages and features.
Along those features are the option to install NomadBSD on ZFS and the use of an
automatic configuration when running NomadBSD in VirtualBox.

New tools developed by the NomadBSD Team and added to version 1.3 are
nomadbsd-dmconfig to select a display manager theme, nomadbsd-adduser which adds
new user accounts and DSBBg to change the background image. All these are using
the Qt-Toolkit.

In Q4 we added two mirrors in France in Germany and would like to thank
nosheep.fr and fau.de for them.

We are looking for people to help the project. Help is much appreciated in all areas:

  * Translation of program interfaces
  * Design artwork
  * Programming new tools, extend existing ones
  * Tests and Bug reports / UX and feature suggestions
  * Mirrors outside of Europe

Open tasks:

  * Support installation on disk partitions and add a partition editor GUI.
  * Complete disk encryption
  * Add a user-friendly network manager
