The FreeBSD Core Team is the governing body of FreeBSD.

- Julie Saravanos, the sister of Bruce D. Evans (bde), mailed core with the sad
  news that Bruce passed away on 2019-12-18 at the age of 68 years.  Bruce was a
  deeply respected member of the community, served on the Core team, and made
  over 5,000 commits.  Bruce's impact on our culture was so profound that new
  terminology was spawned.  This is an excerpt of a message from Poul-Henning
  Kamp to Julie.

      I don't know precisely when I first communicated with Bruce, it was in the
      late 1980'ies via "UseNET", but I can say with certainty that few people
      have inspired me more, or improved my programming more, than Bruce he did
      over the next half of my life.

      All large projects invent its own vocabulary and in FreeBSD two of the
      neologisms are "Brucification", and "Brucified".

      A "brucification" meant receiving a short, courteous note pointing out a
      sometimes subtle deficiency, or an overlooked detail in a source code
      change.  Not necessarily a serious problem, possibly not even a problem to
      anybody at all, but nonetheless something which was wrong and ought to be
      fixed.  It was not uncommon for the critique to be considerably longer
      than the change in question.

      If one ignored brucifications one ran the risk of being "brucified", which
      meant receiving a long and painstakingly detailed list of every single one
      of the errors, mistakes, typos, shortcomings, bad decisions, questionable
      choices, style transgressions and general sloppiness of thinking, often
      expressed with deadpan humor sharpened to a near-fatal point.

      The most frustrating thing was that Bruce would be perfectly justified and
      correct.  I can only recall one or two cases where I were able to respond
      "Sorry Bruce, but you're wrong there..." - and I confess that on those
      rare days I felt like I should cut a notch in my keyboard.

      The last email we received from Bruce is a good example of the depth of
      knowledge and insight he provided for the project:

- The 12.1 release was dedicated to another FreeBSD developer who passed away in
  the fourth quarter of 2019, Kurt Lidl.  The FreeBSD Foundation has a memorial
  page to Kurt.

  We send our condolences to both the families of Bruce and Kurt.

- Core has documented The Project's policy on support tiers.

- Core approved a source commit bit for James Clarke.  Brooks Davis (brooks)
  will mentor James and John Baldwin (jhb) will co-mentor.

- The Project's first Season of Docs ended with a negative result.  The work was
  not completed and contact could not be established with the writer.  No
  payment was made and the financing was set aside for future work.

- Google Summer of Code completed.  Information about the seven accepted
  projects can be found on the wiki page.

- Adam Weinberger (adamw) was added to conduct@.  Adam has demonstrated
  competence, understanding, and fairness in personal matters.

- Li-Wen Hsu (lwhsu) contacted Core after receiving a report from concerned
  local community members about past updates to The Project's
  internationalization policy.  Lengthy discussions took place to determine how
  to reaffirm that The Project maintains a neutral position in political
  disputes.  Updates were made to the document and it was decided that any
  future changes would require explicit Core approval.

- After nomination by Edward Napiera≈Ça (trasz), core voted to grant Daniel
  Ebdrup (debdrup) and Lorenzo Salvadore (salvadore) membership in The Project.
  Both Daniel and Lorenzo have been working on the quarterly reports for the
  past few quarters.

- The Core-initiated Git Transition Working Group continued to meet over the
  last quarter of 2019.  Their report is still forthcoming.
