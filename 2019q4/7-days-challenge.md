The 7 Days Challenge is an educational initiative to help people onboard with FreeBSD more easily.

It will use a combination of tutorials, guides and how-tos to get users engaged with
FreeBSD quickly, target specific end goals the user might have for FreeBSD, and more.

The primary objective is to demonstrate FreeBSD's capabilities as a modern, relevant operating
system in today's Cloud centric, automated business models.
