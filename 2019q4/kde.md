The *KDE on FreeBSD* project packages the software produced by
the KDE Community for FreeBSD. The software includes a
full desktop environment, the art application 
[Krita](https://krita.org/), video editor [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org)
and hundreds of other applications that can be used on
any FreeBSD desktop machine.

The monthly releases of KDE Frameworks, bugfix-releases of KDE Plasma
Desktop and the quarterly feature release of KDE Plasma Desktop
were all landed in the ports tree shortly after upstream releases.
There were also monthly KDE Applications bugfix-releases which also
landed in a timely manner.

Digikam landed a new release thanks to Dima Panov.
We hope this gets rid of the instability caused by the
previous release update from last quarter.

The [open bugs list](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=New&bug_status=Open&bug_status=In%20Progress&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&email1=kde%40FreeBSD.org&emailassigned_to1=1&emailtype1=substring&f0=OP&f1=OP&f2=product&f3=component&f4=alias&f5=short_desc&f7=CP&f8=CP&f9=assigned_to&j1=OR&j_top=OR&o2=substring&o3=substring&o4=substring&o5=substring&o9=substring&query_format=advanced&v2=kde%40&v3=kde%40&v4=kde%40&v5=kde%40&v9=kde%40&human=1)
grew to 32 this quarter with a handful of strange build failures.
We welcome detailed bug reports
and patches. KDE packaging updates are prepared in
a [copy of the ports repository](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports-kde/)
on GitHub and then merged in SVN. We welcome pull requests
there as well.
