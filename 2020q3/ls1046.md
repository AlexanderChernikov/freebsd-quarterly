The Semihalf team initiated working on FreeBSD support for the
[NXP LS1046A SoC](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-based-processors-and-mcus/qoriq-layerscape-arm-processors/qoriq-layerscape-1046a-and-1026a-multicore-communications-processors:LS1046A)

LS1046A are quad-core 64-bit ARMv8 Cortex-A72 processors with
integrated packet processing acceleration and high speed peripherals
including 10 Gb Ethernet, PCIe 3.0, SATA 3.0 and USB 3.0 for a wide
range of networking, storage, security and industrial applications.

Completed since the last update:
 * Upstreaming of the QorIQ SDHCI driver (r365054)

With above the current Semihalf upstreaming activity is complete.
The major out-of-tree supported components:
 * DPAA network controller support
 * QSPI controller support
They work on top of release/11.2.0, but still require significant
effort to adopt to FreeBSD-HEAD.
