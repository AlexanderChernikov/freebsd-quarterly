The Doc New Generation project aims to convert the website and all
existing documentation to Hugo/AsciiDoctor. Right now almost
everything it's converted as you can see in the repositories.

The objective of using Hugo and AsciiDoctor it's to reduce the
learning curve and let people to start quickly with our documentation
system. Other benefits of using Hugo is that we can use other
technologies aside from AsciiDoctor, like MarkDown, RST, Pandoc, etc.

The remaining of remaining things include:
- Finish the conversion of some books to AsciiDoctor,
- Get some tweaks in our CSS to be responsive,
- Some AsciiDoctor extensions to create an index of tables and figures,
- Make a general review.

The dates for making the migration have yet to be discussed.

Patches, comments and objections are always welcome.
