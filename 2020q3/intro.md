This report covers FreeBSD related projects for the period between
July and September, and is the third of four planned reports for 2020.

This quarter brings a good mix of additions and changes to the FreeBSD
Project and community, from a diverse number of teams and people covering 
everything from architectures, continuous integration, wireless networking
and drivers, over drm, desktop and third-party project work, as well as
several team reports, along with many other interesting subjects too
numerous to mention.

As the world is still affected by the epidemic, we hope that this report
can also serve as a good reminder that there is good work that can be done
by people working together, even if we're apart.

We hope you'll be as interested in reading it, as we've been in making it.
Daniel Ebdrup Jensen, on behalf of the quarterly team.
