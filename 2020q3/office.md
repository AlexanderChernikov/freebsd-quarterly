The FreeBSD Office team works on a number of office-related software suites 
and tools such as OpenOffice and LibreOffice.  

Work during this quarter focused on providing the latest stable release of 
LibreOffice suite and companion apps to all FreeBSD users.

 * Alongside with updating old stable branch to latest 6.4.x releases, 
 current ports-tree now have a full-featured cutting-edge 7.0.1 bundle.  
 * Conservative users can keep 6.4.x stable version by switching to use 
 all-in-one editors/libreoffice6 port and even with i18n language pack (off by default). 
 It will be kept updated at least till 7.1.0 version is released.  

We are looking for people to help the project.
All unstable work with LibreOffice snapshots is staged in our [WIP repository](https://github.com/lwhsu/freebsd-ports-libreoffice).
