The FreeBSD Office team works on number of office-related software suites 
and tools such as OpenOffice and LibreOffice.  

Work during this quarter focused on provide latest stable release of 
LibreOffice suite and companion apps to all FreeBSD users.

  * Alongside with updating old stable branch to latest 6.4.x releases 
  current ports-tree now have a full-featured cutting-edge 7.0.1 bundle.  

  * Conservative users can keep 6.4.x stable version by switch to use 
  all-in-one editors/libreoffice6 port and even with i18n language pack (off by default). 
  It will be kept updated at least till 7.1.0 version will be released.
