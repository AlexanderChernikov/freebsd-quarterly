Li-Wen is working on the FreeBSD release code related to Azure for
the -CURRENT, 12-STABLE and 11-STABLE branches.
The work-in-progress is available [here](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D23804).
The [11.4-RELEASE image on Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/thefreebsdfoundation.freebsd-11_4) is published.
We are testing the releng/12.2 branch and 12.2-RELEASE image will be
published to Azure Marketplace soon after released.
